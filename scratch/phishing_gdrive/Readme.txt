MALICIOUS ATTACHMENT DATASET - FEATURE FILES
--------------------------------------------

This folder contains the final feature-extracted CSV files used for training and evaluating machine learning models on malicious and benign attachments.
Each file corresponds to a different document type (Word, Excel, PDF, HTML) and includes either the full set of extracted features or a reduced subset of selected features.

FILE LIST
---------
1. Word_All_Features.csv
2. Word_Top10_Features.csv
3. Excel_All_Features.csv
4. Excel_Top10_Features.csv
5. PDF_All_Features.csv
6. PDF_Top10_Features.csv
7. HTML_All_Features.csv
8. HTML_Top13_Features.csv


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Each CSV file contains a structured table of extracted features for all benign and malicious samples of that file type.

- The “All_Features” files include every feature extracted from the respective format.
- The “Top” files contain the most discriminative subset of features selected using SHAP and Random Forest feature importance analysis.

Each row in a CSV file represents one document sample.
Each column represents a feature or label.

Example columns:
filename, feature_1, feature_2, ..., feature_n, label

The “label” column indicates the class:
0 = Benign
1 = Malicious


FEATURE SUMMARY
----------------
Word files:
- Extracted from DOC and DOCX formats.
- Features include macro presence, OLE object count, hyperlink count, embedded object size, font family diversity, paragraph statistics, and metadata complexity.
- Word_All_Features.csv contains all 94 extracted features.
- Word_Top10_Features.csv contains the 10 most important features selected from SHAP and Random Forest analysis.

Excel files:
- Extracted from XLS and XLSX formats.
- Features include number of sheets, average cell count, formula ratio, macro count, embedded object count, numeric cell ratio, and metadata entropy.
- Excel_All_Features.csv includes all extracted features.
- Excel_Top10_Features.csv contains the top 10 selected features.

PDF files:
- Extracted from raw PDF documents.
- Features include total object count, stream count, compression filters, embedded JavaScript indicator, metadata length, and file entropy.
- PDF_All_Features.csv includes all extracted features.
- PDF_Top10_Features.csv contains the 10 most discriminative features.

HTML files:
- Extracted from benign and malicious webpages.
- Features include script count, external link ratio, keyword frequency (login, password, verify), tag ratio, URL length, and inline JavaScript density.
- HTML_All_Features.csv includes all extracted features.
- HTML_Top13_Features.csv contains the top 13 most relevant features identified during feature selection.


USAGE
-----
These CSV files can be directly loaded into any data analysis or machine learning framework (Python, R, MATLAB, Weka, etc.).

Example usage in Python:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("Word_Top10_Features.csv")
print(df.head())

Each file can be used for:
- Model training and evaluation
- Cross-format feature comparison
- Feature importance visualization
- Dataset benchmarking


RECOMMENDED ML PIPELINE
-----------------------
1. Load CSV file into Python or your preferred environment.
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 70/30 or 80/20).
3. Scale or normalize numeric features if needed.
4. Train classifiers such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Decision Tree.
5. Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Generate confusion matrices or spider charts for performance visualization.


FILE STRUCTURE
---------------
Each CSV follows this structure:

filename, feature_1, feature_2, ... feature_n, label

Example:
sample1.docx, 5, 0, 0.32, 1, 1, 0
sample2.docx, 3, 1, 0.10, 0, 0, 1


NOTES
-----
- The CSV files are cleaned, formatted, and ready for machine learning analysis.
- Missing or invalid data have been handled during feature extraction.
- The same labeling convention (0 = benign, 1 = malicious) applies across all files.
